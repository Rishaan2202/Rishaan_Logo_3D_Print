# Rishaan_Logo_3D_Print
<h3> So this is gonna be a small trinket of my name's (Rishaan) logo, which is an 'R', as it is my name's initial. I have my interest in Math, Physics and Chemistry, so that's why this is made by their mashup (Lightning, Line and Atom). It's a very cool thing!!! idk why a repo is needed for this, but it says to do this before submitting my project! Well idk what should be it's price, so I'm making it $8.5, well I'll return the rest! </h3>

<h3> Take a look how cool it is!!! </h3>
